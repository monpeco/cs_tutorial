###Application Performance

Modern processors use threads to concurrently run multiple operations. If your application performs 
all of its logic on a single thread, you do not make the best use of the available processing resources, 
which can result in a poor experience for your users. In this module, you will learn how to improve the 
performance of your applications by distributing your operations across multiple threads.

At the same time, applications will sometimes rely on long running processes either locally or on a server 
over a network connection.  Application performance can also be seen through the eyes of a user in terms of 
responsiveness.  Through the use of asychronous operations, you can create a responsive user interface that 
allows the user to continue interaction with the application while long running processes execute in the 
background and then return a notification when the operation is complete.


###MultiTasking

A typical graphical application consists of blocks of code that run when an event occurs; these events fire 
in response to actions such as the user clicking a button, moving the mouse, or opening a window. By default, 
this code runs by using the UI thread. However, you should avoid executing long-running operations on this 
thread because they can cause the UI to become unresponsive. Also, running all of your code on a single thread 
does not make good use of available processing power in the computer; most modern machines contain multiple 
processor cores, and running all operations on a single thread will only use a single processor core.

The MicrosoftÂ® .NET Framework now includes the ___Task Parallel Library___. This is a set of classes that 
makes it easy to distribute your code execution across multiple threads. You can run these threads on different 
processor cores and take advantage of the parallelism that this model provides. You can assign long-running 
tasks to a separate thread, leaving the UI thread free to respond to user actions.

Prior to Windows Store applications, .NET developers made use of the System.Threading namespace and Thread 
class to execute multiple threads within an application.  The Thread class is not available in Windows Store 
apps so you make use of the Task class instead.  Creating a task in a Windows Store application will result 
in a thread being created for that task.

When you use tasks rather than threads, the CLR can optimize the number of threads required for concurrent 
tasks and this helps your applications scale better than dealing with threads directly.

###Creating Tasks

The ___Task class___ lies at the heart of the Task Parallel Library in the .NET Framework. As the name 
suggests, you use the Task class to represent a task, or in other words, a unit of work. The Task class 
enables you to perform multiple tasks concurrently, each on a different thread. Behind the scenes, the 
Task Parallel Library manages the thread pool and assigns tasks to threads. You can implement sophisticated 
multitasking functionality by using the Task Parallel Library to chain tasks, pause tasks, wait for tasks 
to complete before continuing, and perform many other operations.

You create a new Task object by using the Task class. A Task object runs a block of code, and you specify 
this code as a parameter to the constructor. You can provide this code in a method and create an Action 
delegate that wraps this method.

> Note: A delegate provides a mechanism for referencing a block of code or a method. The Action class is a 
type in the .NET Framework Class Library that enables you to convert a method into a delegate. The method 
cannot return a value, but it can take parameters. The .NET Framework Class Library also provides the Func 
class, which enables you to define a delegate that can return a result.

The following code example shows how to create a task by using an Action delegate:

```c
// Creating a Task by Using an Action Delegate
Task task1 = new Task(new Action(GetTheTime));
private static void GetTheTime()
{
   Console.WriteLine("The time now is {0}", DateTime.Now);
}
```
