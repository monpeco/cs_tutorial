#Generics
Generics enable you to create and use strongly typed collections that are type safe, do not require you to cast items, and do not require you to box and unbox value types.
###Creating and Using Generic Classes
Generic classes work by including a type parameter, T, in the class or interface declaration. You do not need to specify the type of T until you instantiate the class. To create a generic class, you need to:

* Add the type parameter T in angle brackets after the class name.
* Use the type parameter T in place of type names in your class members.

The following example shows how to create a generic class:
```c#
// Creating a Generic Class
public class CustomList<T>
{
   public T this[int index] { get; set; }
   public void Add(T item)
   {
      // Method logic goes here.
   }
   public void Remove(T item)
   {
      // Method logic goes here.
   } 
}
```

When you create an instance of your generic class, you specify the type you want to supply as a type parameter. For example, if you want to use your custom list to store objects of type Coffee, you would supply Coffee as the type parameter.

The following example shows how to instantiate a generic class:
```c#
//Instantiating a Generic Class
CustomList<Coffee> clc = new CustomList<Coffee>;
Coffee coffee1 = new Coffee();
Coffee coffee2 = new Coffee();
clc.Add(coffee1);
clc.Add(coffee2);
Coffee firstCoffee = clc[0];
```

###Advantages of Generics
The use of generic classes, particularly for collections, offers three main advantages over non-generic approaches: type safety, no casting, and no boxing and unboxing.

###Type Safety
Consider an example where you use an ArrayList to store a collection of Coffee objects. You can add objects of any type to an ArrayList. Suppose a developer adds an object of type Tea to the collection. The code will build without complaint. However, a runtime exception will occur if the Sort method is called, because the collection is unable to compare objects of different types.

The following example shows the type safety limitations of the ArrayList approach:
```c#
// Type Safety Limitations for Non-Generic Collections
var coffee1 = new Coffee();
var coffee2 = new Coffee();
var tea1 = new Tea();
var arrayList1 = new ArrayList();
arrayList1.Add(coffee1);
arrayList1.Add(coffee2);
arrayList1.Add(tea1);
// The Sort method throws a runtime exception because the collection is not homogenous.
arrayList1.Sort();
// The cast throws a runtime exception because you cannot cast a Tea instance to a Coffee instance.
Coffee coffee3 = (Coffee)arrayList1[2];
```

The following example shows an alternative to the ArrayList approach using the generic List&lt;T&gt; class:
```c#
// Type Safety in Generic Collections
var coffee1 = new Coffee();
var coffee2 = new Coffee();
var tea1 = new Tea();
var genericList1 = new List<Coffee>();
genericList1.Add(coffee1);
genericList1.Add(coffee2);
// This line causes a build error, as the argument is not of type Coffee.
genericList1.Add(tea1);
// The Sort method will work because the collection is guaranteed to be homogenous.
genericList1.Sort();
// The indexer returns objects of type Coffee, so there is no need to cast the return value.
Coffee coffee3 = genericList[1];
```
###No Casting
Casting is a computationally expensive process. When you add items to an ArrayList, your items are implicitly cast to the System.Object type. When you retrieve items from an ArrayList, you must explicitly cast them back to their original type. Using generics to add and retrieve items without casting improves the performance of your application.

###No Boxing and Unboxing

If you want to store value types in an ArrayList, the items must be boxed when they are added to the collection and unboxed when they are retrieved. Boxing and unboxing incurs a large computational cost and can significantly slow your applications, especially when you iterate over large collections. By contrast, you can add value types to generic lists without boxing and unboxing the value.
The following example shows the difference between generic and non-generic collections with regard to boxing and unboxing:

// Boxing and Unboxing: Generic vs. Non-Generic Collections
int number1 = 1;
var arrayList1 = new ArrayList();
// This statement boxes the Int32 value as a System.Object.
arrayList1.Add(number1);
// This statement unboxes the Int32 value.
int number2 = (int)arrayList1[0];
var genericList1 = new List<Int32>();
//This statement adds an Int32 value without boxing.
genericList1.Add(number1);
//This statement retrieves the Int32 value without unboxing.
int number3 = genericList1[0];


###Constraining Generics
In some cases, you may need to restrict the types that developers can supply as arguments when they instantiate your generic class. The nature of these constraints will depend on the logic you implement in your generic class. 

The following example shows how to constrain a type parameter to classes that implement a particular interface:
```c#
// Constraining Type Parameters by Interface
public class CustomList<T> where T : IBeverage
{
}
```

| Constraint | Description |
| --- | --- |
| where T : &lt;name of interface&gt;  | The type argument must be, or implement, the specified interface.  |
|  where T : &lt;name of base class&gt; | The type argument must be, or derive from, the specified class  |
|  where T : U |  The type argument must be, or derive from, the supplied type argument U |
|  where T : new()	 | The type argument must have a public default constructor  |
| where T : struct  | The type argument must be a value type  |
| where T : class  | The type argument must be a reference type  |

You can apply the following six types of constraint to type parameters:
```c#
// Apply Multiple Type Constraints
public class CustomList<T> where T : IBeverage, IComparable<T>, new()
{
}	
```
	
###Using Generic List Collections
One of the most common and important uses of generics is in collection classes. Generic collections fall into two broad categories: **generic list collections** and **generic dictionary collections**. A generic list stores a collection of objects of type T.

###The List&lt;T&gt; Class
The List&lt;T&gt; class provides a strongly-typed alternative to the ArrayList class. Like the ArrayList class, the List&lt;T&gt; class includes methods to:

* Add an item.
* Remove an item.
* Insert an item at a specified index.
* Sort the items in the collection by using the default comparer or a specified comparer.
* Reorder all or part of the collection.

The following example shows how to use the List&lt;T&gt; class.
```c#
// Using the List<T> Class
string s1 = "Latte";
string s2 = "Espresso";
string s3 = "Americano";
string s4 = "Cappuccino";
string s5 = "Mocha";
// Add the items to a strongly-typed collection.
var coffeeBeverages = new List<String>();
coffeeBeverages.Add(s1);
coffeeBeverages.Add(s2);
coffeeBeverages.Add(s3);
coffeeBeverages.Add(s4);
coffeeBeverages.Add(s5);
// Sort the items using the default comparer. 
// For objects of type String, the default comparer sorts the items alphabetically.
coffeeBeverages.Sort();
// Write the collection to a console window.
foreach(String coffeeBeverage in coffeeBeverages)
{
   Console.WriteLine(coffeeBeverage);
}
```
	
###Other Generic List Classes

The System.Collections.Generic namespace also includes various generic collections that provide more specialized functionality:

* **The LinkedList&lt;T&gt; class** provides a generic collection in which each item is linked to the previous item in the collection and the next item in the collection. Each item in the collection is represented by a LinkedListNode&lt;T&gt; object, which contains a value of type T, a reference to the parent LinkedList&lt;T&gt; instance, a reference to the previous item in the collection, and a reference to the next item in the collection.
* **The Queue&lt;T&gt; class** represents a strongly typed first in, first out collection of objects.
* **The Stack&lt;T&gt; class** represents a strongly typed last in, first out collection of objects.

###Using Generic Dictionary Collections
Dictionary classes store collections of key value pairs. The value is the object you want to store, and the key is the object you use to index and retrieve the value. For example, you might use a dictionary class to store coffee recipes, where the key is the name of the coffee and the value is the recipe for that coffee. In the case of generic dictionaries, both the key and the value are strongly typed. 

**The Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt; class** provides a general purpose, strongly typed dictionary class. You can add duplicate values to the collection, but the keys must be unique. The class will throw an ArgumentException if you attempt to add a key that already exists in the dictionary.

The following example shows how to use the Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt; class:
```C#
// Using the Dictionary<TKey, TValue> Class
// Create a new dictionary of strings with string keys.
var coffeeCodes = new Dictionary<String, String>();
// Add some entries to the dictionary.
coffeeCodes.Add("CAL", "Caf√© Au Lait");
coffeeCodes.Add("CSM", "Cinammon Spice Mocha");
coffeeCodes.Add("ER", "Espresso Romano");
coffeeCodes.Add("RM", "Raspberry Mocha");
coffeeCodes.Add("IC", "Iced Coffee");
// This statement would result in an ArgumentException because the key already exists.
// coffeeCodes.Add("IC", "Instant Coffee");
// To retrieve the value associated with a key, you can use the indexer.
// This will throw a KeyNotFoundException if the key does not exist.
Console.WriteLine("The value associated with the key \"CAL\" is {0}", coffeeCodes["CAL"]);
// Alternatively, you can use the TryGetValue method.
// This returns true if the key exists and false if the key does not exist.
string csmValue = "";
if(coffeeCodes.TryGetValue("CSM", out csmValue))
{
   Console.WriteLine("The value associated with the key \"CSM\" is {0}", csmValue);
}
else
{
   Console.WriteLine("The key \"CSM\" was not found");
}
// You can also use the indexer to change the value associated with a key.
coffeeCodes["IC"] = "Instant Coffee";
```

**TryGetValue**: Gets the value associated with the specified key.
```c#
// When a program often has to try keys that turn out not to
// be in the dictionary, TryGetValue can be a more efficient 
// way to retrieve values.
string value = "";
if (openWith.TryGetValue("tif", out value))
{
    Console.WriteLine("For key = \"tif\", value = {0}.", value);
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Key = \"tif\" is not found.");
}
```
With the indexer:
```c#
// The indexer throws an exception if the requested key is
// not in the dictionary.
try
{
    Console.WriteLine("For key = \"tif\", value = {0}.", 
        openWith["tif"]);
}
catch (KeyNotFoundException)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Key = \"tif\" is not found.");
}
```

##Other Generic Dictionary Classes

**The SortedList&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;** and **SortedDictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;** classes both provide generic dictionaries in which the entries are sorted by key. The difference between these classes is in the underlying implementation:

* **The SortedList generic class** uses less memory than the SortedDictionary generic class.
* **The SortedDictionary class** is faster and more efficient at inserting and removing unsorted data.
